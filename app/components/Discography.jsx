Interspecies, in collaboration with Green Museum, compiled a sample cd of 350 animal calls and sent it out to various electronic artists including Scanner, Merzbow, and David Rothenberg, among others. What's most compelling about this project is the thoughtful way that the artists have listened and responded — individually and as a community — to the sounds of the marine environment. ",
