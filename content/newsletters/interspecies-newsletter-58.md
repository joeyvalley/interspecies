*As the last newsletter spelled out, Interspecies navigates by a different map than mainstream whale biology. Our oceanic research integrates the skills of a holistic community that includes biologists, but also musicians, acousticians, anthropologists, activists, poets, healers, in fact, anyone offering a sublime idea, no matter how far it wanders from mainstream pre-conceptions of what an animal is or ought to be.*

*The forum Interspecies provides often gives voice to. alternative ways of perceiving nature, speculating about animal communication, and offering creative strategies for both interaction and protection. Recent email discussions about whale culture and consciousness have made American biologists take notice and then squirm in their seats. For an ironic example, we agree with Russian bio-acousticians who stand alone within the scientific community, to assert that prychic phenomena is a basis of beluga whale communication. The credibility we have attained within the mainstream imbues our curmudgeonly role with a responsibility we take seriously.*

*This preface is meant to provide a context for two unusual reports that follow. Read them with an open mind. And recognize them as the tip of the iceberg.*

# Luna's Outreach 

Kari Koski is director of the Sound watch Program of the Friday Harbor Whale Museum. Sound watch provides education to boaters in Puget Sound about the orca’s need for space and quiet. Below, is her report of a provocative interaction. that occurred recently with one of the younger members of this whale population. 

During the spring of 2001 a lone killer whale calf appeared in Nootka Sound, a remote inlet off the west coast of Vancouver Island, B.C. The little whale turned out to be L-98, also known as Luna, a new member of L-pod from the Southern Resident Community of Orcas frequently seen in the Puget Sound Region. No one knows why or how Luna came to be in Nootka Sound.
As of December 2002, Luna remains alone in the inlet with no definite plans concerning his future from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada. Over the summer of 2002 a monitoring and education program was put in place called the Luna Stewardship Project.

Since the end of the monitoring, interactions with people have increased in number and intensity, posing a serious threat to Luna's safety and wellbeing. Current information on Luna, the project and how you can help can be found at: <a href="http://www.salishsea.ca/m3/luna/luna.html" target="_blank">www.salishsea.ca/m3/luna/luna.html</a>.

The following is an excerpt from my log during the time that I assisted with the Luna project.

"We stayed in the small cove and kept watch on Luna. From our distance we could see as he milled, splashed and then dove. We saw no sign of him for more than 5 minutes. Then Puuuf! There he was, right alongside us! He gently pushed our boat in circles while tapping the side with his head, continually slapping the water with his tail and pee fins. His vocals were faint and he paused several times to blow bubbles, open his mouth, and look up to make eye contact. 

We attempted to get away by slowly motoring up, but he followed under the bow· of the boat and hit up very hard, causing us to rock and sway. Although we had been primed on how to get away, we felt very uncomfortable motoring on top of him. After two attempts, we decided to turn off the engines and to sit still in the middle of the boat so as to not encourage him by leaning over or looking at him. 

After a few minutes his pushing/tail slapping behavior became more assertive. We sat for a few more minutes not quite knowing what to do, never having been in a situation quite like this before. 
Feeling that he must be lonely, we did the only thing we could think to do: we began to talk to him. We felt a little silly, but we told him that he should go home, that his mother was still alive and well and that his family missed him. ·we closed our eyes and thought about the route home to Haro Strait where we had been with L-pod and his family just the week before We visualized some members of L-pod; L-57 -(Faith) with his tippy dorsal fin; L-54's (Ino) new baby, little L-100 (too new to be given a name yet); and of course his mama L-67 (Splash) and her striking saddle patch.

As we were sitting there, Luna did a spy-hop-lunge-forward­ maneuver that nearly landed him in the boat! As he came forward his rostrum gently brushed· my forehead, and he slipped back into the water. Surprised by what had just happened, I was left feeling confused and fascinated but not at all afraid." 

While it is not difficult to record our observations of the encounter with Luna, I have found simply sharing the story to be professionally challenging. While writing this article I received criticism for presenting the story, even under an objective lens. 

My science background gives little room or language for speculating on intent. My job has been to observe and record. As the coordinator of The Whale Museum's Sound watch Boater Education Program I have worked to help minimize people's contact with whales and to record whale and boater interaction. 

Simply sharing the story seems to imply some form of extraordinary communication, which I do not mean to imply one way or the other. Yet my credibility has come into question by even remaining neutral. 
Science should be big enough to not limit the sense of wonder and possibility the roots which fuel our quest for understanding and knowledge.

# Michael's Forum 

Last Summer, one of interspecies correspondents, Tim Hinkle, asked me to write down some questions I wanted answered concerning whale communication. This I sent him, and a few weeks later he wrote back providing quite proactive answer. I naturally wanted to know his source. He was reticent to snare it, but when I pressed, he described a channeled entity, named Michael. Michael is not a person per se, but a community of human souls, channeled by Victoria Marina of Half Moon Bay, CA. 

To be honest, it left me speechless, although the info he provided was simply too intriguing to ignore. So began an email discussion over the summer and fall, which has finally subsided enough for both of us to a take collective breather. Make of this dialogue what you will. 
The material that follows is copyrighted. You can find out more at: <a href="http://www.gateway-assoc.com" target="_blank">www.gateway-assoc.com</a>.

**I. Jim Provides Background:** 

Yesterday I talked to a colleague who recently visited a baby orca stuck in a fiord off Vancouver Island. When Kari drew close in her boat, she visualized the whale's family whom she knew well in the course of her research. The whale suddenly lurched out of the water and briefly touched her forehead. 

Today I mentioned this incident to Dr. Toni Froehoff, a dolphin behavioralist whose work focuses on human/ cetacean interactions. Toni told me a story of working with a lone beluga whale last summer in Nove Scotia. This whale also came to her to place its forehead against hers, and then later did the same thing with another person. She was so moved by this behavior that she is currently searching to gather more examples of this provocative behavior. I asked Toni if her paper would describe what the people were thinking about when the whales did this. She laughed as if to imply that, unfortunately, at the present time it is beyond the purview of science. 

**Tim asks Michael:** 

**Question # 1:** First, regarding the Orca anecdote. What made this particular contact possible in the way it happened? And please describe the Orea' s side of the encounter, including perspectives and feelings during the contact. Are there after-effects worth noting for either participant? 

**Michael:** We will begin by com men ting on the overall process of human and cetacean interaction. We think it is clear that utilizing the examples provided, cetaceans can choose to make direct contact with humans in a specific manner which, while puzzling to humans, does have a purpose. We would say that these interactions might require continued studies which can be examined in order to eventually draw conclusions. We understand that it is not enough for us to offer explanations· here for it will take human and cetacean contact over an extended period of time in order to begin to understand the nature of these rudimentary attempts to converse and exchange information. 

In order for us to present a reliable explanation here, it is; necessary to first remind all involved in this study that cetaceans communicate telepathically on a regular basis. They have physical body chakras as do humans, and the sixth chakra is located in approximately the same location on the cetacean body as it is on the human body. Therefore, when a telepathic transmission is initiated, the sixth chakra on both humans and cetaceans is activated. This chakra is located in what might be called the forehead of both species. 

The cetaceans in question were aware of the necessity to communicate directly with the humans involved and could not garner specific attention in any other fashion at the time. Suffice it to say that the method chosen by the cetaceans was intentional, was thought out or intellectually reasoned and then executed, and not the result of an instinctive response such as the canine jumping on the master's knee when the master returns home after a long day at work. 

It is key, that such an action taken by a frustrated cetacean could be seen as a direct action, not only implemented, but held in place for a prolonged period of time. Considering the intention of the orca is important.
We think this type of interaction is not as unusual as you might think, but is usually considered an accident, or even a "cute" action and therefore not recorded as being significant. The particular Orea was attempting to make contact in order to extricate himself from the containment. The actual telepathic communication would be translated as a plea to reunite this Orea. with his family. Indeed, we will agree here that the researcher's thoughts which occurred just prior to the event, did reach the whale, and the whale responded. Due to the young age of this orca, he did not think about whether he was in danger or not (with the human) but instead chose to take a leap of faith and implore the human fragment to help him. 

There was confusion on the part of the whale, for he was not able to understand why he was separated from his family, and how to return. In fact, he was experiencing what human psychologists would refer to as separation anxiety due to the distance from his family.

However, because the human fragment considered., his family, he took the chance and petitioned this human to aid him in his desperate need to be reunited with his family. This whale was experiencing strong emotions at the time, and we would suggest that should such an event occur again, and we think it likely, that the human fragment attempt to clear his or her mind of extraneous thoughts in order to receive the impulse from the whale. This impulse includes emotional content as well as pictures "Or telepathic images. 

**Question #2:** Regarding the Beluga whale. What made this particular forehead contact possible in the way it happened? Please describe the Beluga's side of the encounter, especially it's perspectives and feelings during the two touching contacts. Any after· effects worth noting? 

**Michael:** We will agree here that contact was made between these two fragments, although the circumstance was radically different from the prior example. In this case, the whale was an old soul fragment, a slave, and it made efforts to instruct the human fragment, a scholar, about what is possible between cetaceans and humans. For cetaceans, sixth chakra communications are considered ordinary or expected, and it is surprising to some whales that most humans do not currently have this capability. We might say that this beluga was offering a service to the female scholar (whom they refer to as a student for some reason), which might propel the female scholar into deeper levels of understanding of cetacean communication and life in general. The fact· that the whale twice took the opportunity for contact in such a way again demonstrates intentionality. 

It may take some convincing here in terms of "John Q Public", and it will be necessary to educate people about what is possible with cetaceans over the long haul. We do think that documenting these encounters would be good work for all, so it can be understood by others. 

In this case the Beluga whale enjoyed the company of the female, and therefore made an effort to give her the opportunity to have first-hand experience with 6th chakra interaction between humans and whales. In terms of what the Beluga experienced, we would remind you that the human was a bit puzzled and in awe when this occurred, and the whale understood that. There was little fear involved. 

**Question #3:** Is there any connection between these two examples, and the documented behavior of sperm whales placing their foreheads together which was witnessed by Jim Nollman? 

**Michael:** The sperm whale circular formation was of a different nature than the interspecies communications. This one was a regenerative ritual rather than a direct individual transmission of information. We would suggest continued research into the specific interactions rather than making assumptions that they are all one thing, or another. 

The collecting of such data is likely to be seen eventually in the light that it ·is a series of investigative cornerstones in the understanding of cetacean life. We would also say that dream interactions (are also key). The one described by Jim Nollman does include a direct contact with cetaceans, and these dreams might make information available which was not accessible before. Therefore, we would suggest continued attention be paid to details in both waking and sleeping for cetacean researchers. Jim might wish to inquire if other colleagues have had cetacean dreams and if so, what was the theme or the content, and this includes emotional not just intellectual data. We understand that this comment may be perceived as a digression from the topic, but from our viewpoint is not and instead is an expansion.

**Question #4:** There's an ongoing experiment by Jim Nollman, who is currently off the White Sea in Russia, communicating with Beluga whales. He's set up a 2-way communication. The Belugas can regulate their communication. He has hopes that he will be able to provide a breakthrough in understanding whale intellect. Is this experiment going well? Does it represent progress? What's the perception of the Belugas? 

**Michael:** These emotionally centered fragments are amused, but also interested in making such contact. They would prefer to do so directly with sound, and any time this is possible, this will be their preferred mode. They would enjoy exchange of musical preferences, but find it difficult to present their own music. Interest is piqued, and we think that many of these whales are in fact older souls, which has its advantages and disadvantages. 

**Question #6:** Supposedly there is sound involved, underwater microphones and control over the sound output underwater. 

**Michael:** It would be more efficient if these experiments could be conducted with cetaceans who had interspecies communication as their life task, which is unlikely to be old soul Beluga whales. Belugas are more interested in joy and states of being. Were they to speak directly, they would in fact convey that the simple pleasure of floating in warm water can bring joy to even the most fearful fragments. An afternoon of play with these heart-centered fragments who have long since stopped caring about being unable to manipulate their environment with hands, and have instead adapted to a state of grace ·within their home can be joyous for all concerned. 

**Question #7:** What exactly is the difficulty in presenting "their music?" Please give an explanation of the nature of their music and how they perform it and use it in their lives.

**Michael:** Music is an integral part of the lives of cetaceans just as music is an integral part of the lives of human fragments. Were you to consider this as a truth, then it might be more palatable for the average human to consider that the sounds made by cetaceans especially when they are presented in an extended manner is often a musical expression. 

For example, should a blue whale emit a long tone that might seem to the untrained ear as simply sound, then this cetacean may indeed be expressing an emotion through this vocalization. Often times the vocalization is also accompanied by nonverbal communications which serve as a counterpoint of sorts to the tone itself. 

You might wish to evaluate such soundings in this way rather than as isolated occurrences. As well, it might be difficult to match or pair the whales involved in a duet if they are not in the same proximity one to the other, but we will assure you that a whale on one side of the globe can sound with another who might appear to be out of range.

Were you to consider this as a possibility then we think you would begin - to have more of an idea of the immensity of the musical transit-ways that exit across the planet. It would not be untrue to say that the oceans house a great symphony of sound which is both beautiful and profound in its intricacies. The panoply of sound is a tapestry and one that is by nature the communication of emotions, ideas, personal truth, world truth, universal truth and all areas in between. 

Often a cetacean will begin a sound or tone which is then duplicated by another, much in the way a French horn join in on the exact note initiated by the bassoon. A smaller cetacean has a range of sound which are related to the sounds made by another larger cetacean much in the same way a violin is an instrument several octaves nigher than a cello, for example. These sounds or tones are not unrelated. 

**Question #8:** We know all the various Orea pods have their own unique whistle patterns. Is it a language and if so, how do they encode a vocabulary into whistles. 

**Michael:** Yes, of course this is language. We will begin here by suggesting that as humans express various nuances of emotions through various facial expression, so this is also true with cetaceans in general. 

We will again compare this process to music, as their language is mellifluous in its own way and they (the Orcas) have devised specific patterns of sound that communicate their own whereabouts, for example, as well as their identifying signature. We have brought this to your attention before and realize that this is one area where science in general has been more willing to consider the possibility of language, through the various pod identification sounds. 

The specifics of this encoding have to do with length, duration of sound, and what we will call "multiples". The individual whistles are like Morse code, and there is a whistle that means "yes" and well as one that means "no". It is the stringing together of the whistles which then create more complex communication. 

The two most useful avenues of comparison here are the Chinese script language where different strokes of the brush are used to create combinations which mean different things depending upon what other strokes they are paired with. Another sample is similar to shorthand. There are many whistles that are shorthand for directions such as north, south, east, west, undercurrents, danger, bonding. 

There are many more, obviously, and we do think that some of these have been decoded, but to be truthful here the cetaceans are far more understanding of human language than humans are of theirs. 

# The Politics of Saving Animals 

Ben White is one of the most distinguished and effective protectors of whales and dolphins in the world. He has been a board member of Interspecies for the past five years. His report from CITES, is obviously pertinent to the ultimate purpose of this newsletter, and delineates another aspect of the Interspecies forum. 

Clear environmental victories are hard to find, so I thought I would share with Interspecies the results of the recently completed meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Little known but of huge significance, this organization was established by the United Nations about thirty years ago to control the trade between countries of endangered plants and animals. Every two and a half years about 160 countries meet to debate proposals submitted to either increase (up list) or decrease (down list) the protection afforded endangered species. You may be wondering why it is that any trade is allowed. The answer, sadly, is that endangered species are often highly coveted and valuable; think of elephant ivory, whale meat, rhino horn, rare turtles for pets and unique butterflies. The tragedy is that the rarer they become, the more valuable they are. 

Whereas the original framers of the convention envisioned a way to control the rampant selling off of the wonders of the world, CITES was hijacked early on by those who see the problem as one of conservation instead of protection. Conservation means saving for later use, a construct that assumes that all living beings on earth are resources, here for humans to use. The mantra of the conference, and the criteria used to judge a given use ·of wildlife and plant, revolves around the question of "sustainable use of natural resources." Therefore, the question becomes not how to save the entity from extinction but how to divide up the body.

Considering this framework, it was surprising how well we did at this conference. By "we" I refer to those who work to save life on Earth. Every meeting is attended by a slew of "NGO’s", non-governmental. observers from two basic camps the users and the savers. The users include the ivory carvers, tortoiseshell craftspeople, the pet industry, Disney, the zoo industry, and the big game hunters. On the other side are the Animal Welfare Institute (which I work for), Humane Society, the Born Free Foundation, Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society and many more-most organized under the Species Survival Network. This year over sixty proposals were submitted. They are debated and voted on in committee, and then, in the final two days, reviewed in the plenary session when everyone comes together. In plenary, decisions are approved quickly, one by one, unless a country wants to re-open debate. This requires approval of 1/3 of the voting countries.

To succeed, proposals need to win a 2/3 majority. Four different pivotal proposals narrowly failed in committee: the increased protection for whale sharks, basking sharks, mahogany wood and the Black Sea population of bottlenose dolphins. We lobbied hard for all four in the week between the two votes and, on· the last days of the conference, we prevailed. The sharks were the first ocean fishes, and the mahogany the first valuable forest product, to be extended protection under CITES. 

Increased protection for the dolphins was especially satisfying to this longtime opponent to the captivity industry because they were being taken for aquarium and amusement parks. As far as I know, this is the· first time an international forum has decided to protect any cetacean from the short and miserable life expected when they are taken from their home and families and relegated to tanks for our amusement.

We also emerged victorious opposing the Japanese in their perennial attempt to open up the trade in Brydes and Minke whales, a move designed to circumvent the current moratorium on commercial whaling within the International Whaling Commission. Dozens of. species of land turtles, butterflies, lizards and parrots were also granted increased protection.

Our greatest defeat at the meeting was the approval for three countries, South Africa, Botswana and Namibia, to sell their stockpile of ivory in a one-shot deal. But even this will only be allowed after a degree of proof is provided that the sale will not increase the poaching of elephants (a link most observers believe is quite clear). Zambia and Zimbabwe were turned down completely in their request to sell their ivory. And all five were denied their request for a yearly quota. 

From this one meeting, millions of creatures and rare plants are better protected now than a month ago. The Species Survival Network (SSN) performed the most intelligent and comprehensive organization of effort I have ever seen, as can be seen in the changed votes. After many frustrating international meetings, this one made me believe that we can go toe to toe with the users. And win. 

# Interspecies News 

I began this newsletter by mentioning our holistic forum for the discussion of new ideas about whale communication and whale protection. In fact, this network now seems to have attained a critical mass. As I compose this edition of the Interspecies newsletter, I am designing our 2003 program with colleagues, media contacts, activists, patrons, and consultants in many countries. The upcoming program includes: 

<br />• Whales field projects in Mexico, with cachalot, in Canada with dolphins, and in Russia with beluga whales.
<br />• A keynote talks about whale communication in March at the European Cetacean Society's conference held in the Canary Islands.
<br />• A collaboration with artists, technicians, and activists to produce a unique musical performance about whale sounds, with the audience floating in a swimming pool. Concerts are already planned for Kodiak Alaska in April, and at Berlins famous Liquidrom performance pool in June to accompany the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission.

A musical project to produce a CD of whale call-based "techno" music in cahoots with the online Greenmuseum.org

<br />• Adapting a graphing technology, called "wavelets", to help analyze whale calls, and programmed by Interspecies consultant Mark Fischer. See an example on the cover, or visit our website at interspecies.com to view an entire gallery of these gorgeous images which make whale calls appear as pure energy. And sometimes, squid.
<br />• Media consultation focused, on the Japanese whaling industry's latest putsch to add mercury-toxic whale meat to the Japanese National School Lunch Program.

# The Sea Monster 

An unexplainable sound has been recorded many times since 1997 on a U.S. Navy undersea microphone system. The Navy scientists, themselves, suggest that what they are listening to may be the call of an unidentified giant deep ocean beast nicknamed 'Bloop'. While the recording displays the varying frequency hallmark of a marine animal, it is far more powerful than the call of any creature known on Earth, Britain's New Scientist reported on Thursday. 

The sound is simply too loud to have been generated by a whale. One theory is that it is a deep-sea animal, so large that even the conservative Navy scientists refer to it as a deep-sea monster.

Bloop was first detected by U.S. Navy sensors In 1997, clearly recorded by hydrophones located 3,000 miles apart. The navy has deployed these sensors to detect the movement of Soviet submarines. The volume of the sound was much louder than any recognized animal noise, including that produced by the largest whales. 

ls it a huge octopus? A giant squid? Although dead giant squid have washed up on beaches, and tell-tale sucker marks have been seen on whales, there has never been a confirmed sighting of the elusive cephalopods alive in the wild. The largest dead squid on record measured about 60ft including the length of its tentacles, but no one knows how big the creatures might grow. For years sailors the world over have told tales of many-tentacled monsters of the-deep called krakens, that could reach as high as a ship's mainmast and sink the biggest ships. 

Phil Lobel, a biologist at Boston University, Massachusetts, doubts that giant squid are the source of Bloop. "Cephalopods have no gas-filled sac, so they have no way to make that type of noise," he said. "Though you can never rule anything out completely, I doubt it." Nevertheless, Lobel agrees that the sound is most likely to be biological in origin. 

The system picking up Bloop as well as other strange noises from the deep, is a military relic of the Cold War. In the 1960s the U.S. Navy set up an array of underwater microphones, or hydrophones, around the globe to track Soviet submarines. The network was known as SOSUS, short for Sound Surveillance System. The listening stations lie hundreds of yards below the ocean surface, at a depth where sound waves become trapped in a layer of water known as the "deep sound channel". Here temperature and pressure cause sound waves to keep traveling without being scattered by the ocean surface or bottom. Most of the sounds detected emanate from whales, ships or earthquakes, but some very low frequency noises defy explanation. 

Scientist Christopher Fox of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Acoustic Monitoring Project at Portland, Oregon, has given names to the various signals, . including Train, Whistle, Slowdown, Upsweep and even Gregorian Chant.

He told New Scientist that most of the loudest sounds can be explained as ocean currents and volcanic activity. The sound known as "Upsweep", for example, was tracked to an erupting undersea South Pacific Mountain. "Sound waves are like voice prints," says Fox. "You're able to look at the characteristics and say: 'There's a blue whale, there's a fin whale, there's a boat, and here comes and earthquake." 

You. can hear Bloop, Upsweep, and other sounds recorded by this hydrophone array at the US Government site: <a href="http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/vents/acoustics/sounds_mystery.html" target="_blank">http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/vents/acoustics/sounds_mystery.html</a>.
