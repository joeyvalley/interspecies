Weaver ants have developed a language based upon upper body movements. Two examples spring to mind. Firstly, they utilize a distinct side-to-side, face-to-face, antennae waggling dance when communicating"the presence of nearby food to other workers. And secondly, when a weaver ant chances upon an intruder, even at a considerable distance from the nest, she stops foraging for food and releases a pheromone (an alarm scent) into the air which attracts reinforcements. If the adversaries are numerous, some of the summoned weavers soon break off from the fight and immediately return to the nest, all the while laying a pheromone trail to and from the battleground. Back at the nest, these messengers now recruit other workers to the fight by jerking their faces back and forth, toward and away from the nestmate. 

This recruitment gesture includes yet another feature strongly suggesting that the animals are firstly thinking, and secondly acting upon those thoughts. Instead of immediately setting off down the odor trail, some of the recruited ants now tum to other workers and repeat the same head gestures even though they have not been directly stimulated by the invaders. In other words, the second line of communicators, and so on down the chain, communicates a message learned directly from a communicated signal, and not from the pheromone itself. In this manner, a maximum number of recruits is enlisted very rapidly. 

The prevailing scientific view about the matter describes these actions in some detail, but then enforces a veritable code of silence about interpreting them. Traditional entomologists limit their speculations about the depth of weaver ant communication to the guarded comments that the antennae rubbing may transmit the actual odor of the food; while the recruitment gesture is little more than an instinctual motion that resembles the movements employed in fighting only coincidentally. 

But Donald Griffin, from whose book, Animal Thinking, this example was lifted, wonders if the issue of weaver ant communication can be sloughed off so downright ungenerously. He remarks that the intruder dance may just as easily be interpreted as an intentional pantomime. Furthermore, the two communications are just that, communications -and prime expressions of animal consciousness. The two distinct gestures convey two distinct messages about what is to be done at the end of the odor trail. 

Griffin believes that the scientific communfty stands guilty of not ascribing consciousness to weaver ants despite the fact that their own evidence strongly suggests it. He adds that his colleagues err on the side of anthropocentric absurdity when they declare that it is nothing but coincidental that the fighting dance actually succeeds in preparing the ants for fighting rather than food gathering. It seems akin to believing that it is only coincidental that building nuclear weapons prepares human beings for nuclear war. 

Griffin's book takes strong issue with the predominant scientific bias against animal consciousness: 

*"Recognizing that most communication between ants involves chemical signals, which would be almost impossible to decode if they are at all differentiated, we should maintain open minds about the possibility that these simple distinctions among. recruitment messages might be only the more easily detected components of a versatile system of chemical communication. I am extrapolating here far beyond anything that these scientists or their colleagues have suggested. When asked how they know that these ants cannot entertain any conscious thoughts, the scientists usually fall back on the prior conviction that insects are genetically programmed automata and that their brains are too small to permit conscious thinking. Evidence of differentiated communication has not yet altered this deep-seated conviction."*

Back in the 1920's, South African naturalist, Eugene Marais, spent ten years watching termites and ants, and concluded that colonies may be best understood as a composite being possessed of both a group purpose and a group mind. We actually misconstrue the whole organism when we perceive, individual workers as if they might be independent little insects living out their lives in a tight social context.

Consider them instead as building blocks, the ultimate communistic slaves, internally programmed to do the bidding of their queen and nothing beside. For her own part, the queen's control over her workers seems based upon some communicative mechanism far beyond our ability to explain, although some might liken it to telepathy. For example, when Marais enclosed a termite queen within a tiny steel plated prison, the colony continued to flourish. But if he killed the queen, even inside that same prison, the whole community soon ceased to work. At certain times of the year the termites would immediately set themselves to the genetic task of grooming another queen. However, at other times of the year the colony seemed quite incapable to "build" themselves another queen. Inevitably, the entire hive soon died.

If another termitary grew close by, the workers soon drifted into the new colony where they apparently "swore allegiance" to the new queen, because, in fact, there was no sign of rejection. However, if these same disinherited termites were immediately brought to a nest a hundred yards away, a fight quickly led to the deaths of all the intruders. As Marais explains it:

*"The mysterious power which streams from the queen functions only within a limited distance. Every termite is under its power. If the two termitaries are situated close to each other, the power of each queen operates in both nests. It is through this psychological power of the queen that the termites of one nest are capable of recognizing their fellow citizens and discovering strange intruders."*

When Marais waited a few days before attempting to transfer the befuddled workers to a more distant nest, he found that they were no longer attacked. Whatever power the old queen might have possessed over her minions had evidently "evaporated". The now empty workers, like bits of computer memory, were available to be filled up with the program of a new hostess. But by what power does the queen hold the community together? Marais comments:

*"We will assume that it is something analogous to scent. Personally I do not think it is scent but something much more subtle. But if we think of it as scent it will simplify matters for we are actually dealing with something far and away beyond human sense."* 

In Godel, Escher, and Bach, Douglas Hofstadter abstracts the metaphysical findings of Marais even further, and so describes many eery similarities between a functioning ant colony and the self-aware human brain. For example, Even. though an ant colony is comprised of ants, its power and function can no more be apprehended as a collection of ants than the power of the brain can be apprehended as a collection of brain cells. Just as our minds can not sense the firing of individual brain cells when we think our thoughts, so the ,colony can not sense the movements of individual ants off fulfilling their programmed function. Yet despite this mutual inability to sense the lower level of meaning, brains and colonies both remain mysteriously unified and coordinated through some, as yet unexplained teleological mechanism. We call the sum total of all these functions, consciousness, as it refers to human brains. Yet harking back to Griffin's complaint, there is not yet any commensurate term to describe the same process as it refers to ant colonies. Could we do any better than also calling it consciousness, although a kind of non-human version of the concept which is very alien to ourselves? 

Where I live in the Pacific Northwest, thrashing ants build large mounds out of sticks and pine needles, sometimes two feet or more on a side. Each mound might contain as many as several hundred thousands ants. The ants try to keep to themselves, although they sometimes build their mound too close to my own house. When that occurs ant bodies start popping up in our sink, in dinner, and in bed. Eventually I feel bound to do something about this insect invasion before it gets totally out of hand. However, I refuse to use the standard remedy of diazinon. I don't want to destroy them, merely move them further away from my own house.

So instead, I spray gasoline on the surface of the mound and simply set it afire. Of course I am aware that this presumed communication technique probably sounds utterly violent. But wait! Try instead to perceive of the colony, and not the individual ants, as the conscious entity being addressed here. After all, the queen, is safely ensconced deep inside the heart of the mound, and suffers no harm. Most importantly, she indubitably gets the message, and soon directs her workers to move the colony from its present location. For some unexplained reason, the colony almost always moves further away from my own house. I can't explain why, although it certainly makes me feel glad.

Personally, I find myself prey to the most uncomfortable of fantasies whenever I step inside the ten foot radius of an ant colony's sel(-aware, personal space. Is this a case of the heebiejeebies, or has my relationship to the colony turned me super-sensitive to the hypnotic spell being cast by a telepathic queen? I sense that the colony has tacked up a psychic signal inside the billboard of my own mind: beware you fool, inner sanctum, you trespass at your own risk. One part of my own mind seems to fear that it might actually get taken over by ant commands causing me to start jerking my head from side to side in recognition of the enemy. That enemy is, of course, myself. Furthermore, this risk is double-edged because the enemy I face is also a real-time confrontation with my own worst fantasies about swarming ants. What if a sudden stiff gust of wind should pick me up bodily and drop me onto the mound?

</div> -->

Even as I dream up this nightmare of ants as a violation of my own personal space, so the living, breathing ants insist upon going about their business of swarming outside of my own dreamt up fear of them. What irony! When it comes to human/ant relations, violation and interspecies communication are starting to sound like variations on the same theme. 

Actually, my own relationship to the local thrashing ants seems more than a bit like something out of Alice in Wonderland. For example, a bewildered Alice wishes to wake up a sleeping Red King because he happens to be dreaming about her: 

*"'It's no use your talking about waking him,' said Tweedledum, 'when you're only one of the things in his dream. You know very well you're not real.' 'I am real!' said Alice, and began to cry."*

# Beluga Project 

The beluga whales are among the most gregarious of cetacean species. Because their vocalizations are so exceedingly melodic in nature, the beluga has long been known as the canary of the sea by Arctic explorers. Yet because of their icy habitat, they are among the least visited of all cetacean species. Asfar as we know, IC's ongoing work with the belugas is the first interactive study ever conducted with this species in the wild. 

The IC Beluga Project is now slated to occur during the first two· weeks in July up along the MacKenzie River Delta of Arctic Canada. This project, now in its third year, focuses upon our own crew of musicians interacting with the.beluga whales who venture into the Delta in July to nurture their newborns. 

Despite the fact that just about the only humans the belugas ever encounter are hunters trying to kill them, these small whales are also well known for venturing right up to a human wading into the shallow estuary to meet them directly. In other words, the belugas avoid outboard motor noise yet still favor human contact. In keeping with this preference of the whales, much of our own research this summer will be based upon dry-suited humans in the water creating quiet acoustic music. Our objective is simply to participate with the whales, to let them decide the parameters of the unfolding relationship. We hope to document a new leaf in the several thousand year old relationship between human beings and beluga whales.

Our international crew of four (possibly five) includes: 1) IC director, Jim Nollman 2) Canadian Arctic liaison, Jonathan Churcher 3) Photographer Daniel Dancer, whose work has been published in Life and Outside, among others. 4) German Conceptual Artist Michael Hemann. We are still trying to negotiate the participation of Soviet cinematographer, Andres Slapins.

This project has recently been invited to locate along the Anadyr River Delta in Siberia during summer 1990, as the guests of the Soviet Government.

# Living Green 

*The Green Movement is more than a political ideology because Green values also involve how we live every day. This list isfor those who have the "Green Spirit" and would like to incorporate it further into daily living. How does it relate to communicating with animals? Think of it this way: only by activating the items on this list, can our great-great-great grandchildren have an opportunity to interact directly with the great whales, the elephants, the ravens, the wolves. This list was created by IC board member Christoph Enderlein and his wife Mary-Clayton. Feel free to copy, but do not change it without permission.*

# IC News and IC Needs 

IC is experiencing a slight decline in membership renewals. On that note, please tum to the last page of this newsletter. If you find a reminder label affixed there, we hope you'll take a few minutes to renew. We recently tried a form letter as the remedy, and found that most of the people who responded had simply forgotten. One renewing member pointed out that many people are so inundated by non-profits seeking money, that they may not respond unless we also use the mass-marketing approach. Quite honestly, we think that mode uses entirely too much paper. And as you can see from the notice on the first page of this newsletter, we have switched over to recycled paper. 

The IC Orca project is gearing up for its 12th year with the areas who inhabit the east Coast of Vancouver Island. We have recently chartered a forty foot boat to use as our onsite recording studio during the entire month of August. Our crew is fast approaching the limit of 25 participants. There will be a full report in the next Newsletter. 

We at IC have been using an IBM computer system for nearly three years now. Unfortunately, as the newsletter gets more and more graphics and memory intensive, we are continually running up against the incompatibility which seems built into the OOS world. All to mean that we seek one of the new MacIntosh Desktop Publishing Systems. If any of our readers has any ideas on how we might get a donation of a Mac II computer, laser printer, scanner, and software please let us know. 

And lastly, IC is not currently merchandising Jim Nollman's book, *Animal Dreaming*. This has occurred because the publisher, Bantam Books, has recently sold out of the first edition and has decided to hold off printing the second edition until January 1990, when it will be reissued simultaneously with Jim's new book, *Spiritual Ecology*.
