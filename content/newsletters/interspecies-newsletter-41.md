# Swimming to Utopia

*The relationship between cetaceans and humans has been in news more often than usual during the past six months. Much of it is discouraging. While many people work hard to free orcas from oceanaria in Florida and San Diego and put them back into Puget Sound, boaters crowd the Sound's resident wild orcas from their fast-dwindling food supply. In Baja, Mitsubishi moves forward with a plan to mine salt in one of the gray whales prime breeding grounds. These (and other) issues seem unrelated, and thus beg for a conceptual ooerview, which the concept of The Cetacean Nation attempts to address. I begin with a general critique of the proposal to giue it a context. Then comes the proposal itself. Lastly, is a short discussion of what causes people to belieue cetaceans deserve such special status. As always, IC takes the stand that the visionary relationship we haue with cetaceans provides a harbinger of how we should be relating to all of nature. When you finish reading the 3-part essay, read it again, but this time swap grizzly bear, green turtle, or trumpeter swan for euery reference made to cetaceans.*

*- JN, Dec 1997* 

# I. 
The concept of a cetacean "nation" was the most visionary notion floated at a recent whale conference I attended at Hervey Bay Australia. The idea was originally conceived in 1961 by Dr. John Lilly, subsequently advocated in the 1970' s by Jacques Cousteau, crystallized as a white paper in 1993 by one of the founders of Greenpeace, Michael Bailey, and promoted at the 1997 conference by Scott Taylor of the Cetacean Studies Institute in Santa Fe. 

When I first heard the term discussed, the very idea of a cetacean "political entity sounded completely unrealistic. After reading Taylor's precis, and then discussing it with him in some detail, I came to understand that, of course, cetaceans hold a unique power over the human imagination. What other family of animals has a human abolition movement fighting for its freedom, as captive dolphins do? What other animals have their own commando police force (Sea Shepherd Society) willing to place life and ships at risk to uphold international wildlife laws? What other family of animals can prompt a multi-million-dollar industry founded on the premise of people simply watching them move through their field of vision? 

Placed in this context, the idea of the cetacean nation seems no more extraordinary than the mobilization of human resources that has developed all over the world to save the whales during the past twenty years. The success of that movement suggests that we may be already half-way towards the establishment of a cetacean nation. 

The political resolve that sustained the worldwide save-the­ whale movement will never be able to rest until cetaceans are granted some unique political status that insures their sanctuary in perpetuity. Given the fact that realpolitik's consistently grants resource incentives a precedence over the environment, what better way to absolutely assure the cetaceans' right to life than to grant them the status of a United Nations protectorate? Until that happens, whalers and whale lovers will continue· to push and pull like two immoveable forces responding to one another in a way reminiscent of the military stalemate on the North Korea border. Ironically, the UN has long kept the peace at that beleaguered border. 

The cetacean nation is much more than a political proposal. It serves as an apt metaphor for the growing environmental dream that envisions the human community respecting and honoring nature as more than a resource. The eventual success or failure of the concept offers all of us a barometer to measure the vision and compassion that our own species must attain if the natural world is to survive intact into the next century. The cetacean nation gives us all a glimpse of the politics of the seventh generation. 

The Cetacean Nation Manifesto's promotion of captive dolphins seems both counterproductive and troubling. Scott Taylor has responded to my criticism in this way. All capitols are his: 
"There is no escaping the fact that there are domesticated Dolphins among us now. More research, done in an enlight­ened way in appropriate facilities, by carefully trained and screened people is what I'd like to see. I'm convinced this is possible. It will take major investment by a visionary to set up a beautiful facility with every consideration taken for the Dolphins who now live among us. We owe it to ourselves and the dreams of the Dolphins as we know them, to take our relationship to them seriously, to take full responsibility for them as sentient beings with inalienable rights. Dolphin Assisted Therapy is one area that will produce some astonishing breakthroughs in the near future." 
In that light, Taylor seems not so much a promoter of holding dolphins’ captive in concrete pools for reasons of "research", but a seeker after something new-an as yet undefined situation where humans can easily interact with cetaceans. 

Both John Lilly and Scott Taylor have told me that the kind of project Interspecies Communication Inc. de­ signed and implemented for The Human­ Dolphin Foundation in Careyes Mexico in the early 1980's is their ideal situation. In that case, IC spent five months playing live music out on the ocean at a specific locale at a certain time of day, for a set duration. Six spotted dolphins eventually came to us at that place and at that time, instigating games and music-making experiments of their own. 

One note about the manifesto as presented here. I have taken some liberty editing it for flow. Read on and imagine. 

# II.

**Cetacean Nation**<br />
by Dr. John Lilly, Michael Bailey, and Scott Taylor 

The concept of human rights has slowly developed over the last few centuries. Many of the rights we enjoy in the United States today have been further defined and codified as laws. History teaches that our rights evolved through several stages:
<br />1. The unconscious acceptance of a lack of rights 
<br />2. The conscious awareness of the need for adequate expression of rights 
<br />3. The formulation and definition of fundamental rights 
<br />4. The establishment of governmental and legislative structures by which rights become protected thru law. As individuals learned through experience that they did not always share the benefits of laws, they developed the means to make their cause heard. 

This same situation can now be seen reflected in the lives of cetaceans. Recognized as having brains which are in some ways more biologically complex than humans, and possessing social structures as sophisticated as human culture, the question arises: should cetaceans be given rights under human laws? 

The future of many species of whales and dolphins is in question. The Baiji, or Yangtze River Dolphin, the Vaquita found in the Sea of Cortez, and the North Pacific Right Whale are but a few species who are close to extinction as a result of human activity. To ensure the survival of the cetaceans in light of the continuing onslaught by human beings, it is essential that they be recognized for what they truly are: non-terrestrial intelligent lifeforms. 

Indeed, cetaceans have the same inherent rights that human beings have to survive and to live in peace. To attain this goal, it is essential that the cetaceans are recognized by human society as the intelligent lifeforms they are. It is with this goal in mind that a Cetacean Nation is now being initiated. 

# Purpose 
<br />1. To foster greater understanding of the minds and consciousness of whales and dolphins.
<br />2. To develop methods and technologies to enhance interspecies communications between humans and cetaceans. This includes acoustic technologies, a better understanding of echolocation as the basis of holographic sound communications, and the potential for human-dolphin mind connections.
<br />3. To gain recognition from the international human community of the inalienable rights of cetaceans, especially freedom from intrusion and specicide by humans.

That these goals may be achieved in time to ensure the preservation of most species of whales and dolphins, a series of endeavors should be initiated. This involves a recognition of the need for Cetacean Nation representation in human political and industrial society. 

The process starts by obtaining signed statements of support from Non­ Governmental Organizations supporting the general recognition of Cetacean repre­sentation in the human world. It also in­cludes the organizing of electronic data­ bases, libraries and international forums for the advancement of communication studies between human beings and cetace­ans. We must begin to promote-via the mass media-current information on the technologies, techniques of existing and past projects whose purpose enhances human/cetacean understanding and communications.

The goal is to have cetaceans represented as a nation within the frame­ work of the United Nations. This goal will most likely be fully achieved once consistent communication links with any one of the many species of whales or dolphins has been established.

# Validation 

Validation of this cetacean political status within the United Nations as well as among the general public involves:
<br />1. Recognition by individual human beings of the need for eventual cetacean representation at the United Nations and other global forums. 
<br />2. Gaining recognition, via letters and endorsements for the Cetacean Nation from non-governmental organizations and other geo-political groups. 
<br />3. Gaining non-governmental organization status for the Cetacean Nation, initially represented by human beings as spokespeople 
<br />4. Recognition within human governments and within international conferences and forums for the need to explore and research the possible methods of establishing consistent communications with cetaceans so that they may receive the recognition of deserved status.
<br />5. Recognition and validation of the Cetacean Nation through the passage of resolutions at international conventions, conferences, or similar forums. 
<br />6. Recognition, via letter or other endorsements, from one or more member countries within the United Nations for such representation. 
<br />7. Recognition of cetacean species as a nation and a separate group of intelligent, sentient beings that should be afforded the fundamental rights to survival and happiness in keeping with those afforded human beings in modem democratic so­cieties. 

# Goals 

This seven-step plan is achievable provided there is sufficient interest and support from human beings who wish to accomplish these goals on behalf of cetaceans. To initiate this global endeavor, the wide base of dolphin communications studies needs to be consolidated and compiled in such a manner that all researchers and laypeople have easy access to the developments in cetacean communications that have occurred over the past 30 years. The Human/Dolphin Foundation library of information and materials is being consolidated, along with libraries of information garnered from oth­ers who have also engaged in cetacean communications projects and endeavors. This research and information includes: 

<br />1. scientific research papers, video, film and still photographic images of cetacean activities. 
<br />2. Various Media that demonstrates cetacean/human interactions via music, audio tapes and other acoustic mediums. 
<br />3. Proven and possible usages of existing and future communication technologies. 
<br />4. Anecdotal accounts of human/ cetacean communications through physical and telepathic means. 
<br />5. Other cetacean communication research, observations, information and materials.

Many of the current cetacean-human communication efforts are limited in their scope, due to their limitations in information availability. The result is that many of the people who are developing new technologies, methods and strategies for human-cetacean communications are unaware of the advances and results being made by others. 

For example, Louis Herman's students working on captive dolphin studies at Kewalo Basin Hawaii periodically publish scientific research papers on their communications studies. Yet these papers are seldom read by others who are conducting musical or acoustic interaction, or who are developing communications and interactions via swimming with cetaceans in the ocean. There are also people who are working towards engaging in mind connections with dolphins and whales, who are unaware or do not know how to access information pertaining to acoustical, visual and cue-based communications at oceanariums. Moreover, many of these researchers working with captive animals are unaware of the methods of communication that have been implemented and used by non­ scientists.

In order to expedite the needed breakthroughs in human-cetacean communications, reduce duplication of efforts, as well as develop consistent communications with cetaceans, human promoters of the Cetacean Nation need to:

<br />1. Compile and organize existing information from the United States, Europe, Russia, Australia and other parts of the world where cetacean communications studies have been conducted 
<br />2. Create an electronic database for easy access worldwide so that those wishing to understand and access the existing human knowledge on cetacean communications can do so from their own countries with relative ease 
<br />3. Organize forums and study groups of cetacean researchers and interspecies communications enthusiasts so as to determine the best steps towards establishing consistent human cetacean communications links.

# III. Political. Science

We at IC are well aware of the cultural and intellectual hurdles that arise presenting ideas like The Cetacean Nation. Even providing a forum for such visionary ideals sometimes pegs an editor as un­ grounded. We choose the middle ground. On the one hand we are equally skeptical of both mainstream science and the new age. On the other hand, we have long been proponents of providing a forum where idealists and mystics cari reinvent the world to fit their views of Utopia. 

One reason the Cetacean Nation may seem ungrounded, is because it tangles with our anthropocentric notion of politics. It is as if the adjective "human" is so intrinsic to the meaning of "politics" that it doesn't even need to be spoken. 

Then again, a hundred-and fifty-years years ago the exclusion of women and people of color from the working definition of politics was as normal as the exclusion of animals is today. 

Many people believe that cetaceans are in a class by themselves. John Lilly called them humans of the sea, another anthropocentric term that doesn't quite hit the mark, although everybody gets the general idea. The term we actually seek mixes totemism with IQ and politics. 

Several books are published each year that conclude the toothed whales (odontocetes) specifically the dolphins, and their close cousins the orcas, are not only beings of sentience, but of outright genius_ If even a smidgen of these claims is to be believed, then we must conclude that odontocetes possess the compassion of a Jesus, the social skills of a Utopian politician, the intellect of Einstein, a great Yogi's control of body functions. In other words these cetaceans are the most intellectually, physically, and emotionally gifted of all species on Earth, including humans. The claims sometimes tum bizarre. One recent study concluded that the dolphin brain has the ability to receive human pop songs through its own built-in AM radio receiver, a claim spawned by a researcher who insisted he heard Brian Adams and Whitney Houston melodies in dolphin whistles. 

# Emissaries 

Dolphin devotees insist that several delphinid species are eager to communicate with human beings, but only in the wild. Swimmers interact with dolphins on a regular basis in many sites around the world. All these people enter the ocean with a snorkel, a mask, and fins, and then maneuver into a position that encourages dolphins to approach. Some do it with, and some without, an overarching strategy. Many who try it insist they have established a deep spiritual connection with cetaceans. They report with sincerity that the non-verbal communication has utterly transformed their lives. Although no one can say for certain why dolphins go out of their way to interact in such a cordial but intense manner, many swimmers speculate that these are evolved beings who know full well the havoc we wreak upon the oceans. Some swimmers go so far as to conclude that the dolphins interpret our enthusiasm to swim with them as a plea for direction. In other words, these bays and sand banks serve as councils and lecture halls where the natural and the cultural interpenetrate to uphold what some people would prefer to call the supernatural. In his book, The DETA Factor, author and mystic Timothy Wyllie sum up the dolphins' motive this way:

"I had the impression the dolphins were starting to come to terms with the nature of man. They were having to make some very basic adaptations in order to understand us. I saw how they had broadened the base of their capacity to perceive negative 'emotional wavefronts' in order to make contact with us." 

In "The Call of the Dolphins", author Lana Miller reports a channeled entity explaining the dolphin's interplanetary role on Earth.

"Extraterrestrials had to leave because of fear. The dolphins are perceived as lower life forms-now acting as emissaries. We are non-threatening and when we in­ vite people to come and play and share and open to love, they are more ready to accept that there is intelligence beyond self, love beyond self." 

# Virtual Dolphins 

It's not only mystics who grant special powers to cetaceans. Swimming with dolphins has been documented healing the sick, especially those experiencing psychological trauma. In Florida, psychologist Betsy Smith and occupational therapist Patricia Saint John have implemented programs where autistic children are given the opportunity to swim with captive dolphins. While mainstream observers of the medical phenomenon conclude that a proximity to dolphins works its magic by simply distracting patients from their suffering, Saint John disagrees, insisting that dolphins possess a genuine healing power that accelerates a child's vocal and physical development She has never explained to satisfaction precisely how they achieve this objective, but prefers to rely on the universal term known as "dolphin healing energy".

David Cole of the Aqua thought Foundation believes therapists do not, necessarily, need to use real dolphins to reap the benefit of the unique healing energy of cetaceans. Insisting that the clinical practice of employing captive animals for healing purposes is anachronistic and cruel, Cole substitutes flesh and blood animals with. a virtual dolphin swim. 

The patient enters a flotation tank, with water heated to body temperature and made neutrally buoyant by the addition of Epsom salts. Special goggles show videos of dolphins and whales swimming in the ocean. Headphones play their vocalizations. Cole claims this computer­ generated therapy demonstrates a measurable effect on the immune system, specifically balancing the two lobes of the brain through the production of alpha waves.

Similar results have been attained in Japan where patients simply lie on a couch to listen to cetacean calls and echolocation through headphones. An unusual incidence of alpha waves is the result. The researchers have reported back to us, that IC' s own audio cassette of orcas interacting with human musicians, Orcas Greatest Hits, consistently produces the strongest incidence of alpha waves_ This seems surprising, because the music is often rau cous. 

The best known, and perhaps the least mystical of all cetacean healing program is in England, where Doctor Horace Dobbs has created Project Sunflower. For fifteen years, Dobbs has bundled up his manic-depressive patients into dry suits and then dropped them bodily into the Irish Sea to swim with wild dolphins. He reports that the will to live is strengthened almost immediately. Withdrawn depressives suddenly start to talk again, to smile, to enjoy life. Dobbs concludes: 

"We may not know yet how to measure whatever it is that dolphins radiate, but the evidence for its existence is becoming insurmountable." 

# Mysterious Familiars 

Whatever it is these so-called "small toothed whales" radiate, the other cetaceans seem to possess it, more or less, as well. We admire them all, not only for their playful behavior and intellectual potential, nor just for the vast proportions of certain species and the auric energies reputed to emanate from others, but also for the empowering gifts they seem to bequeath to just about everyone who experiences them. 

Cetaceans swim through our cumulative field of vision as mysterious familiars, untamed wisdom givers who encompass the human yearning to behold both the sacred in the wild as well as to experience relations with an alien intelligence. 

Yet just at the moment we feel we must know something new and vital about their strength, their intellect, their essence; they dive beneath the sea into some nether realm we can never enter, shocking us to realize we have learned little about them, although something essential about ourselves.

# Responsibility

I choose to conclude this discussion of the Cetacean Nation with a letter published by the December 11, 1997 Seattle Times written by Donna Sandstrom, director of The Orea Alliance. Speaking about the harm done to the Pacific Northwest orca population by the oceanarium captures directed by Ted Griffin twenty-five years ago, Ms Sandstrom asks us to find a new way to regard the whales_ That the captures happened, and that at the time almost no one spoke out against it, gives an idea of just how far we have all come in our political relations with cetaceans.

*Dear Editor:*

*Even after all these years Ted Griffin seems unwilling or unable to accept responsibility for the havoc, he helped wreak on the orca populations, and the undeniable trauma that resulted. He and Don Goldsberry are responsible for the deaths of 64 whales out of the 66 captured. Only two are alive (Cork - and Lolita).* 

*It is a responsibility we all share, by virtue of our collective longing to encounter cetaceans up close. How do we satisfy our curiosity, that desire to learn more about them, without harming the animals or their habitat in the process? That is the challenge that is before us as a species.*

*We'll never get there unless we acknowledge that displaying cetaceans in aquariums is inappropriate and inhumane. There is no tank big enough to simulate an orca' s habitat.*

*I have talked with people who witnessed the captures, who have said that the cry the young orcas made as they were separated from their mothers, they will carry with them to their grave. What hope there is for communication between our species, lies in our ability to hear that cry and respond to it.*

# Cow Funeral 

We seek member's stories about encounters with animals that suggest ritual and conscious thinking. This report is filed by IC member Shirley Hill from Leveret, Massa­chusetts. 

*A number of years ago I lived on a farm in Virginia with about a dozen cows, a bull named Peewee, several horses, and a mule named Jack. One evening my husband, my daughter, and I were out for a stroll when we came upon a dead calf. As we stood contemplating the cause of death, one of the cows wandered up, looked at the calf and then walked up a hill where it started mooing. The other cows came by, some from the nearby wooded area, some from the other side of the hill. With their own calves in tow, they formed a semi­ circle around the corpse.*

*Peewee appeared and walked into the open side of the semi-circle. He lowered his massive head to the ground in front of the dead calf, then threw his head into the air and wailed. he did this three times. The only other time we had heard him make a sound was when the cows were in heat. Then he turned and walked off into the woods. The cows and the calves followed.*

*The horses and Jack the mule were present this entire time, standing back away from the cows. Now, they walked closer, as if paying their respects.*

*The whole scene was so clearly a funeral to us that we almost didn't believe what we had seen. Needless to say, my opinion of the meaning of life and consciousness within the animal world was stripped of all its limits as a result.*

# IC News: Oceanic Community

Walter van Varik is a Dutch visionary presently visiting the United States, gathering information about how, today, he can conceivably make a difference to the world all our great grandchildren inherit. During the past six years, Walter has sailed some 25,000 miles across oceans in a 45-foot catamaran.

His dream is now focused on gathering together a community of eight to ten people based on an ocean-going catamaran of his own design, and sail the world bringing a message of peace and community at every port of call. He is already preparing to build the sailboat with his own funds, and is now traveling around the U.S. interviewing prospective communitarians to join him. It will be the eventual community's job to devise a program of their own choosing. 

Walter came to IC's attention, because we already go out on the ocean to interact with whales and dolphins. Walter wishes to incorporate the potential for both interspecies community and communnication into his boat. In his own words: 

*"I anticipate the commune will consist of four people who will live more or less permanently on board, plus four additional people who will come on board for shorter periods of time. The boat will have enough space for sixteen people to live together for shorter periods of time. This would allow the possibility to organize an educational and/ or therapeutic program. For the community to be successful, I imagine starting with experienced people willing to live their ideals, but not such strong ideals that they get in the way of shared living."* 

Walter invites anyone interested in founding a community on the ocean to participate in a two-week minimums trial period from April 7-21, April 23-May7, or from May 9-21, aboard O'shana, a 37-foot sailboat now docked in the Sea of Cortez. A contribution of $400 is requested to cover boat costs which will include food basics. A few skilled work exchanges may be possible.

# Zero Circles

IC core member, Daniel Dancer, has recently received funding from a private donor, for his Zero Circles Project. Daniel is a nationally known Earth artist whose sculptural pieces meld environment with a sense of the sacred. His past pieces have included a giant condor feather made from stones near the Sespe Condor Preserve in southern California, and a giant Christmas tree composed of thousands of defunct telephone books laid out and stacked on a tree grid by hundreds of schoolchildren and then photographed from the air.

The IC zero circles project will visit all the US national forests over a six-month period and, in each one, compose a unique variation on the number zero, in support of the Sierra Club's call for zero cutting in our national forests by the year 2000. The circle is among humanity's oldest icons of wholeness and healing.

# Book Reviews 
**Secrets of The Ocean Realm**<br />
Michele and Howard Hall<br />
Beyond Words Publishing

I met Howard Hall 20 years ago in Japan. He was working as the underwater cameraman for a film about the dolphin kill at lki Island which included a segment about IC's role of directing dolphins away from the fishing boats. One night Howard and I talked about the risk of diving with sharks, for which he was gaining a reputation, and the risk of swimming with orcas, which I had done the previous summer. Howard believed it was completely safe to swim with almost all the shark species. He could not believe that I would ever choose to get into the water with orcas. Different drummers. 

The publisher of this book, Beyond Words, is making a well-deserved reputation for producing some of the best designed books of our time and Secrets of the Ocean Realm continues that tradition. It is one of the most beautiful books of underwater photos I have ever seen. The images are sublime, not only for capturing the luminescence of the underwater subject matter, but for the unusual photo­ graphic detail of cuttlefish and kelp, sea horses and sperm whales. Staring at a massive school of squid, the prickly mouth of a mako shark, or the gnarly snout of a gray whale has never looked so surreal. 

The text is another matter. It is garbled and repetitious, tenses switch with­ out notice. The writers often lose their train of thought. They don't seem to know or care about the basic rules of grammar. A good editor, or better yet, a ghost writer, would have made this book a classic. As it is, poor writing tarnishes the superb photos.

*...It became suddenly dark. A great shadow had passed over my head. I looked up into the sunset light lancing through the surface far above. Silhouetted against the golden light flew hundreds of bat rays. The swirling school looked much like a great flock of huge birds circling before begin­ning an evening migration.*

*...I got close to the squid feeding on the tuna. It was nearly six feet long and looked to weigh about a hundred pounds. I reached out and touched the animal. I was surprised by its texture. It was not a soft, snail-like creature. It's flesh was hard and muscular. It flashed from white to angry red as I touched it. Then a tentacle lashed out gripping my arm. I felt a stinging on the back of my hand and instinctively recoiled. I looked at the back of my hand and saw small drops of blood beading up. The squid's tentacles were covered with power­ful sucker disks, each of which was armed with needle-sharp hooks.*

*...I came across a large male dolphin as he swam slowly over the sand., his nose almost touching the bottom as he used echolocation to detect fish hiding beneath the surface. Suddenly the dolphin stopped, his body becoming vertical as he scanned a small patch of sand. Then he began digging ...opening and closing his mouth to pump water and sand from the ever-deep­ening hole. I was so excited I almost swallowed my mouthpiece! Soon his entire head was beneath the surface. He had dug at least eighteen inches into the bottom ... he rose clutching a small razorfish in his teeth.* 

**The Last Lords of Palenque** (1982)<br /> 
by Victor Perera and Robert D. Bruce<br />
University of California Press

The author, Victor Perera recently visited the IC office as he prepares to write his next book about the ritual life of whales as well as the people who study them. This older book, his best known, delves deeply into the lives of the last traditional Mayan tribe living in the jungles of southern Mexico. The writing focuses on the healing work and knowledge of the tribe's shaman, Chan K'un, who has since died. For anyone who has been moved by the fiction portrayed as fact in the Don Juan books of Castaneda, take a look at this book for an in-depth study of the real thing.

*... The gods were displeased and loosed a deluge on the men of wood. Eagles, jaguars, tapirs were sent to gouge out their eyes and mangle their bones. Black rain fell day and night. In the end, even their domestic animals and their pots and pans rebelled against the soulless men of wood. "You have eaten us, and now we shall eat you," said the birds and the dogs. Even the faithful hunting dogs who had been ill treated leaped on the wooden men and tore out their faces. When the men of wood had been destroyed, the few survivors became the forest monkeys.*

*... A Lacandon farmer becomes so enraged at the animals that keep raiding his cornfield, he finally lights incense to Akinchob, the god of maize and protector of farmers, and asks to be changed into a jaguar, so he can chase the animals off. When Akinchob accedes to his request, the farmer/jaguar sees the animals as his kin, and instead of chasing them, he takes pity on them. "You poor people," he says. "You must all be hungry. Come in, come in, I have plenty to eat in my cornfield."*
