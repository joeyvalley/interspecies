# Live Music with Killer Whales 
During August of 1984, IC sponsored a month-long wilderness event, held in the inland waterway between Vancouver Island and the mainland of Canada. This event, our 6th continuous year of **THE ORCA PROJECT**, offered a group of 27 participants the opportunity to invent an interspecies community with the resident pods of free-swimming orcas. As sponsor, IC provided an island wilderness camp, and a 36-foot boat wired up as a recording studio/whale research platform. The very best interactions with the whales occured after dark. 

At night, the underwater background noise diminished, and the whales, themselves, seemed much more receptive to initiating interspecies relations. From our boat studio, we transmitted live music created on electric guitars, synthesizers, and especially the human voice-either singly or in chorus. The singers ranged in age from 6 to 67. Their attempted communcations varied from mimicking orca sounds, whistling, reggae rhythms, the theme from "Koyaanisquatsi", and several songs made up on the spot. All of these songs were transmitted directly into the water via an underwater speaker system. Likewise, all of our recordings of the human/whale interface, were made through hydrophones, also underwater.

Our music was extraordinarily effective at attracting the orcas close to our boat. There the wliales would stay, sometimes for hours at a time: vocalizing, surfacing beside people in small boats, swimming very close to people chanting on shore, echolocating within inches of our speaker, tail slapping the water, and breaching. Occasionally, the whale's powerful vocalizations would change in response to our own modifications. Thus a basis for communication was explored and then established-both species playing with energy exchange known as dialogue.

Two distinct pods visited our boat. The "early group" came for ten nights in a row precisely between 10:30 and 11 :30. This group was characterized not only by their time consistency, but also by a distinctive behavior. They stayed on the surface much of the time, blowing and circling the boat, occasionally breaching. They began each session with an identifiable call-andresponse, which was followed by long periods of quiet investigation through echolocation. One night, this early group stayed within 100 yards of the boat for 2Â½ hours. 

The "late group" visited our boat between 3 and 4AM for 3 nights in a row, and intermittently at other times, both day and night. This pod preferred to listen to our music from 100 yards off a nearby point, vocalizing constantly in a repeated signature pattern. Eventually, they would swim in very close to the boat, often remaining entirely underwater, still vocalizing constantly. One particular orca in this group vocalized with such a unique timbre, and sounded enough like a bagpipe, to earn the name" Angus". Angus can be heard vocalizing with guitar near the end of side A of the cassette tape.

The recorded results of our attempt at interspecies communication are sometimes obvious if not startling. Other times, the exchange is much more subtle, and it may take you several close listenings to this cassette, before you hear it at all. Side A is an edited compilation of bits and pieces, which demonstrate some of our high points Side Bis an unedited 19 minute slice on an early group interaction that, in toto, lasted for 2 hours. The clicking that can be heard at intervals throughout the tape is the sound of the orcas echolocating sometimes like a tongue click, other times like a snare drum. 

IC has just issued a limited edition cassette tape of some of these human/orca interactions from **ORCA PROJECT '84**. These we now offer to our readers at $11 which includes postage and handling.

# The Underwater Sound System 
IC stands at the forefront of a discipline that explores the many varied communication channels open between humans and animals. Much of this work is acoustic, and most of this acoustic research is manifested through the medium of salt water. Consequently, IC must develop a significant proportion of its own hardware. Because we use so much customized gear in our work with cetaceans, most of our sound equipment is quite expensive to develop, and often just as expensive to maintain. Over the years, IC has consistently allocated a substantial portion of each annual budget to hardware develpment. 

People ask us, is this expense a case where money and technology distorts rather than serves communication; separates rather than brings us closer to the animals with whom we choose to work. We don't think so. We encourage participants in our field projects to relate to the animals through touch, or silence. We promote people to explore their own telepathic abilities. We always leave it to the animals to be as they wish, to contact us in the wild when they choose to venture in close. We respect the spontaneous simple relationships-the very healing experience of simply being with each other and the whales.

Simultaneously, we continue the acoustic exploration through what Schumacher cal Is, appropriate technology. Nothing fancy or gimmicky, rather, simple yet very high quality systems that provide an auditory relationship with these animals. In the words of IC acoustic designer,-Mike Sofen, "it is my goal to develop a technology that is 'transparent' and user friendly".

For just one example-the underwater sound system, our umbilical to the whales, is generally considered state-of-the-art in the field of marine acoustic technology. It has evolved slowly through constant use, and in at least four different forms in the past five years. Its current incarnation exists as three portable, waterproof boxes. When all of its companion outboard gear (speakers, hydrophones, microphones, etc) are plugged in, we are able to listen clearly to the underwater environment, transmit and shape sounds either from a tape source or microphones or any number of instruments, and lastly, record the hoped-for human/whale dialogue. All of our equipment is powered by 12 volt batterie~. At this point we are able to turn most boats, and even a kayak, into a fhighly sophisticated recording studio. 

Our next additions to this system include digital audio ahd video recording capability, a 'radio-hydrophone system that will allow us to monitor over great distance, and true underwater stereo recording. We are now developing our own hydrophone design, which we hope will eventually lower the cost and boost the fidelity. of each unit.

We encourage other cetacean researchers to contact us if you would like to use our equipment, or consult with us about developing your own systems. 

# Communication Through Touch: Interspecies Interactions with Verifiable Results

There is hope for the millions of animals around the world who find their lives limited by cement enclosures with bars, noise pollution and lack of privacy. It is a way of improving life for the "ambassadors" of the animal kingdom who choose to represent their species in our zoos. In the past, Interspecies Cornmunication focused its research on the communication of animals with man,in their natural habitat where there are fewer variables involved than communicating with them in zoos. IC's director of research, Jim Nollman, is concerned with the restrictive environment of the captive animals, and has been looking for positive ways to contribute to their well-being. He sees the T.E.A.M. work as being of immeasurable value to this effort. IC members Linda Tellington-Jones and Suzanne Cordrey, are developing a way of relating to captive animals that makes a difference in their lives: communicating through touch.

Traditionally, zoos have held that wild animals should not be tamed. This concept is still basic policy internationally, even though a large number of animals are born in captivity. Touching has a profound effect on the wellbeing of all creatures. Linda Tellington-Jones is a master of a unique method of touch that produces dramatic changes in relieving pain and stress in animals and people. She is now sharing this with the zoo world to relieve stress and aggression.

Linda is an expert interspecies communicator who has enriched the lives of horses and their trainers through her T.E.A.M. work. T.E.A.M. (Tellington-Jones Equine Awareness Movements) is the technique of communicating through touch, and is an alternate method of training and healing. Non-stressful, nonhabitual movements used in this method release tension in the body. The Tellington "Touch" allows the brain to receive and reorder messages so that where tension is being held in the body from a previous pain or habit, a pleasurable, new response is now recorded.

In contrast to the old adage that animals learn only by repetition, Linda has found that working with an animal for one session will dramatically change him and give him more options as to how to relate to his environment. Linda's work is based on the Feldenkrais Method of awareness of movement and functional integration for humans. She has expancled upon this method to produce extraordinary results in both animals and people.

Linda began working with zoo animals in 1975. Since then, she has made contacts at the Moscow Zoo, Zurich Zoo, as well as the Chicago and San Diego zoos. She feels that the animals need to be acknowledged for the contribution that their presence in captivity makes to our lives and that they be cared for in a way that contributes to their mental/emotional health and wellbeing. Zoo animals are an important connection to the animal kingdom and many are still being ignored and isolated; many will not breed in captivity Zoo animals are a vitally important link between man and the animal world, which is more apparent as natural habitats are declining. If we can create an environment in which animals can thrive, zoos will offer more positive human/animal interactions.

Linda met San Diego zookeeper, Art Goodrich, through one of her T.E.A.M. clinics for horses. Art took the Tellington "Touch" back to his captive animals and noticed immediate and profound results. For 12 years he has observed how animals adapt to captivity and has seen many suffer emotionally from the trauma of capture and isolation. He uses the touching technique to form a relationship with the animals that creates an awareness and trust between them. He can then distinguish what the animal needs and create a situation that enriches the animal's life.

Art succeeded in transforming the zoo's Somalian Wild Asses who bit and kicked each other during their mating season. No one could get near them to treat their wounds until he began using the T.EAM. method with these animals.

The zoo's prize possessions, two male Okapis, are endangered South African zebra-like animals who are so shy in the wild that their dwindling numbers are not even known. Art has been able to approach them and work with them and now has one following him around, nudging him for attention.

Art's technique is not complicated. He combines the Tellington "Touch" with careful routine and visualization. He believes that exotic animals respond positively to routine. So he goes about feeding, cleaning the enclosures. and approaching them in exactly the same way each day, as close to the same daily time schedule as possible Knowing what to expect, the animals relax. When fear and pain are dissolved, learning is achieved; friendships develop.

Art talks to his animals. He mentally visualizes them doing what he wants them to do, and concentrates on seeing them healthy, happy and integrated with their environment. He creates a rapport with the animals and establishes eye contact. He speaks softly and gets down on their level physically to assume a non-threatening posture. He is sensitive to their feelings and always observes their behavior for the smallest clues as to what stimulates positive reactions. Respect, trust, and sincerity are the key ingredients.

The intimate attention, understanding and care he gives to each animal is true interspecies communication and an inspiration for all of us in this work.

Linda and her assistant, Suzanne Cordrey, are interested in expanding their connections with zoos a-nd animal preserves If you have any contacts in the zoo world that you would be willing to share with them or if you would like more information on the T.EAM. touch, please contact them at:

# President's Note: 
In the past this column has been utilized to expose important political and environmental situations, particularly Seaworld, Monkey Mia, and Lake Tyers. In summary, Seaworld's requests to capture Killer Whales off Alaskan shores have been denied for the time being, however they are expected to make further petitions in the future.

The proposed hotel complex to be built in Monkey Mia has been curtailed due to the efforts of the Dolphin Welfare Foundation there. Thank you to those of you who responded to both those issues by writing letters of concern. As for Lake Tyers, the enclosed dolphins have returned to the sea as torrential rainstorms opened the channel that had previously prevented their escape. So at present these three situations have been stabilized.or completed.

This issue of the newsletter is an attempt to open up the organization to other contributors and to let you, as reader, share in the availability of outside information and sources that IC believes in and works with. At this time, IC is marketing along with Jim Nollman's record, "Playing Music with Animals," a cassette from this summer's Orca Project, as well as several difficult to acquire books and articles. Other books will be available in the future, but for now, only Wade Doak's *Dolphin, Dolphin* and the book *Water Babies*. (Please refer to book list for further information).

One twenty-five page article on the Dolphin Legend is being offered, as it is the only written material on the history and mythology of the dolphin. The legend itself is an ongoing unfolding of information emanating from Australia, and its perpetuator, Peter Shenstone, is adding to it continually. The article is taken from **SIMPLY LIVING**, a fine magazine that weaves stories on anthropology, art, cetaceans, ecology, etc. with more general "new age" and "conservative" topics. Along with unusual articles, the magazine's outstanding feature is the quality of photography and graphics. It is not yet available in the States but can be ordered directly from Australia; the address follows.

Finally, over the years, Jim Nollman has used a musical instrument called a Waterphone to resonate sound through water while working with cetaceans. It was developed by Richard Waters, an inventor living in California. If you would like more information regarding this instrument, his address follows as well.

Interspecies Communication as an organization is growing and beginning to work with other individuals, groups, and networks across the country and throughout the world. This is a wonderful time of expansion and a necessary undertaking. It is imperative to the survival of all living things that we work together, put our differences aside, and look to a greater whole. We therefore ask our readers to contribute in any way you can, i.e. articles, additional names of individuals that might be interested in receiving the newsletter, memberships, and contributions. We welcome your input and are grateful for your continued support. 

# The Dolphin Council

Held over two weeks time, on the land of the Ojai Foundation in Southern California, the Dolphin Council brought together representatives from a growing family of interspecies communicators from various fields. Together, we explored the patterns that connect the dolphin as archetype and as marine mammal, as fact and as fiction, as religion and as science, and as a symbol for the embattled relationship between humans and animals on this planet in the late 20th century. The presenters during the event included anthropologists Joan Halifax and Francis Huxley, musicians Paul Winter and Jim Nollman, legendarian Peter Shenstone, researchers John and Toni Lilly, and artists Jean-Luc Bozzoli, Ki, Michael Remann, and Adelle Getty. This event was produced by IC core member Gigi Coyle. There is already interest in planning a similar event next fall, with an emphasis more on communicating with all species. We shall announce this event in future newsletters.

"Our wisdom is that of the past and of the future. We have been joyously awaiting this time of evolution for the planet, sending our healing rays to the earth, assisting those who are aware of us, and soon, to release to the sensitives of the Colden Age the wisdom of the ancients. The time is quickly approaching when humans will have ears to hear this knowledge, and will begin 
to benefit from it. This information comes as Truth and Beauty. It is the information of Love. It is a combination of technical-scientific data with the vibrations of Universal Love. For on your planet these aspects have been separated. We now return knowledge to wholeness. The knowledge of telepathy*, history, transportation, 'unknown' energy sources, are but a few of the intelligences that we shall communicate to you, and in fact have been communicating to some of you for hundreds of years. We serve as inspiration for many and we are your teachers on planet earth. Come learn from us and play with us. For our means of teaching is through joy and trust. All is in perfect order and when the time is proper, mankind will 
receive the full breadth of our knowledge." - *Dolphin Message given to Joan Ocean, July 23, 1984* 

*This word does not reflect the accurate concept. The vibrational exchange we refer to as "telepathy" is expanded to mean an exchange of radiations between dolphins and man which then creates a new and more perfect image-tone in its fusion. An original, unique thought-form; rather than a sharing of already known thoughts.
