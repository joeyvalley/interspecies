# When Nature is Larger than Life

<div class="inset-text">
It is said that he who knows well how to live meets no tigers or wild buffaloes on his road, and comes out from the battleground untouched by weapons of war. For in him, a buffalo would find no butt for his horns, a tiger nothing to lay his claws upon, and a weapon of war no place to admit its point. How is this? Because 
there is no room for death in him.<br />

In October of 1988, I was invited by Greenpeace to join an effort to rescue three Grey Whales stuck in an ice hole a few miles outside the town of Barrow Alaska. Because Interspecies Communication Inc., (IC) has developed a sound system that permits humans to transmit sound and music directly to whales underwater, it was hoped that I would be able to develop some acoustic method to coax the whales out of their hole and towards the open sea again. Yet despite the obvious connection, it still took three phone calls from the Greenpeace representative in Barrow to coax me away from the balmy Fall weather of the Pacific Northwest, and up to this Eskimo village where the pre-halloween thermometer was already hovering around minus fifteen degrees fahrenheit. Simply put, I was simply not convinced that the whales ought to be saved.

Therewas a precedent. Two years earlier, the Russell Glacier of Southern Alaska slid down a mountainside to seal off the mouth of a fiord, trapping seals, porpoise, and who knows what other manner of unfortunate beast behind an ice barrier. In that case, I had waffled interminall~f oefore deciding not to put the resources and experience of IC to task. For one thing, nobody in command seemed to know if the animals were actually in any danger. In more general terms, when efforts to save this or that species reduce down to saving one of this or two of that, the best of motivations too easily degenerate into a case of human beings tampering with the natural order in order to fulfill their own human agenda. Yet despite my own hollow advice to let the glacier do its thing, the rescuers decided to fly north; believing as they did that sheer altruism overwhelms any inference of tampering.

Am I callous to ask what it is about human morality that insists we rally behind any activity that hints of an altruistic outcome? In that case, the incipient saviors of the Russell Glacier savored their essentially archetypal role of good guys possessed of good human know-how utilized in the good cause of aiding helpless marine mammals. Yet the rescue team also seemed to exhibit too much power and glory; a near-mythological motivation to control and tum aside a natural process of nature by exerting maximum human ingenuity and minimal sense-of place. But why not? Weren't we humans guilty of massacring marine mammals to the point of extinction? By god, didn't we owe it to those icebound porpoises?

The Russell Glacier mission became a media event of the first magnitude. Jounalists from every newspaper and broadcast news network within the USA as well asfrom a half dozen other countries descended upon the Russell Glacier like vultures around a poached rhino on the African Veldt.

The media insists that it reports and never createsthe news. But this state of affairs would also mean that Isaac Newton was wrong when he wrote that the acceleration of a body is directly proportioned to the applied force. In the case of the Glacier rescue, Newton's equations worked out to mean that the Saviors could not easily' pack up their bags and go home when they started to suspect their efforts may have been in vain. Not only was the sheer immensity of aÂ·cold damp Alaskan fiord dampening their enthusiasm: but the porpoises, themselves, were stubbornly resisting every opportunity to be corralled. But the applied force of seeing one's own image up there on the tube every day can induce the invincibility of a cocaine high. Celebrity engenders its own virtue, as it also certifies heroism. That which was perceived as the whole world offering encouragement, also overwhelmed any intuition that it may have actually beeh time to throw in the towel. Instead, news reporters and news makers ended up working together like a well-oiled team; artificially stimulating what might just easily have been a natural event bound by the laws of entropy.

Unfortunately, the machinery of the news business sometimes clogs when events choose not to develop at the news' own speed. So the rescuers were coerced to implement ever more newsworthy metaphors, known in the trade as *sound-bites*, until even the project's most ardent supporters noted that the rescue had deflated into a parody of a rescue. Perhaps unfairly, that subtle shift in mood was not lost on all the articulate op-ed columnists whose job it is to analyze the tone and grist of the news. These men and women tend to pounce whenever they perceive even an atom of newsmaking insincerity. Predictably, they pounced upon the rescue operation of the Russell Glacier; never pleading accoundtable to the fact that they are another cog of the very same news generating machine that set the operation spinning in the first place. IT was a bad moment that turned into a bad media event. Or vice versa.

For its own part, the glacier acted very glacier-like if not also like a superhero. It receded, rescuing sea mammals, rescuers, and journalists in one fell swoop. Ironically, none of the entrapped seals or porpoises seemed very interested to take advantage of what the humans interpreted as a positive swing

Speaking of media, some zoos, including New York's Bronx Zoo, put TV sets in gorilla's cages to relieve their boredom. A survey reports that these TV-watching gorillas prefer love scenes, weight-lifting, and auto-racing to any other programs.

# Membership News

The non-profit funding world is a tenuous business at best. So IC needs to put more emphasis o n attracting new members if we are to survive in a changing philanthropic climate. We have a few ideas about how to do this, and it involves some input from you. Firstly, we ask each of you to consider anyone who might like to become a member. Send us his/her name, and we'll send them a sample newsletter. Secondly, we would gladly send any of our members a few extra copies of the newsletter for private promotion and distribution. Thirdly, if any of you know of any foundations or individuals who might smile upon IC with a grant, please send any info you may have. Fourthly, if the mailing label on this newsletter has the letter 'f above your name, that means that y o u receive the newsletter for free. We consider this to be one of our services as a non-profit, but also ask that you please consider contributing something, anything. 

And lastly, the work of IC has received a fair amount of publicity over the past year including: 1) a description of our work in the book, *Diet for a New America* 2) a feature interview with Jim Nollman in the June *Animals Agenda* magazine 3) Interviews and articles resulting from the grey whale rescue. This has resulted in a constant stream of requests for sample newsletters. If the mailing label on this newsletter has the letter 'p' above your name, that means that you requested a newsletter, which we then sent, but we never heard from you again. 'P' stands for potential, and so we send you one more issue before deleting your name from our list. If you resonate with our work, then please contribute what you can. We really do need your support.
